    description: "The Lincoln Corsair replaced the MKC as Lincoln's compact luxury SUV, aligning with the brand's shift to conventional naming rather than alphanumeric designations. Built on the Ford C2 platform shared with the fourth generation Ford Escape but substantially differentiated in design, features, and refinement to create a distinct luxury identity. The exterior features elegant proportions with horizontal lines, a distinctive Lincoln grille, and a sloping roofline, embodying Lincoln's 'Quiet Flight' design philosophy. Initially offered with two turbocharged four-cylinder engine options: a standard 2.0-liter producing 250 horsepower and an available 2.3-liter delivering 295 horsepower, both paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. The Corsair went on sale in late 2019 with Standard and Reserve trims. The interior features an 8-inch infotainment screen running Lincoln Sync 3 software with a dashboard defined by an integrated air vent design spanning the width of the dashboard. Transmission is controlled using buttons mounted under the vents. Optional upgrades include a 12.3-inch fully digital gauge cluster with integrated navigation, 24-way 'Perfect Position' power seats, a 14-speaker Revel sound system, and a heads-up display. A driver assistance suite branded as 'Co-Pilot360' comes standard, including blind spot monitoring, automatic emergency braking and lane keep assist. The Grand Touring plug-in hybrid variant arrived in 2020, combining a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine with an electric motor for all-wheel drive and approximately 28 miles of electric-only range."

    description: "The 2023 facelift brought significant updates to the Lincoln Corsair. Exterior changes include a new larger grille, LED daytime running lights, and new exterior colors. The interior receives a larger 13.2-inch touchscreen with Sync 4 software where the HVAC controls now reside, and the 12.3-inch fully digital instrument cluster is now standard across all trims. The base Standard trim has been renamed to Premiere. The 2.3-liter engine option was discontinued, while the 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder and plug-in hybrid Grand Touring remain available. The Corsair is now available with Lincoln's ActiveGlide hands-free advanced highway driving assistance system. Production concluded in December 2025 at the Louisville Assembly Plant, with Ford announcing discontinuation after the 2026 model year to make way for an all-electric pickup. The Corsair has been Lincoln's best-selling vehicle since its introduction."
