    description: "The Lincoln Corsair replaced the MKC as Lincoln's compact luxury SUV, aligning with the brand's shift to conventional naming rather than alphanumeric designations. Built on the Ford Escape platform but substantially differentiated in design, features, and refinement to create a distinct luxury identity. The exterior features elegant proportions with horizontal lines, a distinctive Lincoln grille, and a sloping roofline, embodying Lincoln's 'Quiet Flight' design philosophy. Initially offered with two turbocharged four-cylinder engine options: a standard 2.0-liter producing 250 horsepower and an available 2.3-liter delivering 295 horsepower, both paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. In 2021, the Grand Touring plug-in hybrid variant was added, combining a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine with an electric motor for a total system output of 266 horsepower and approximately 28 miles of electric-only range. The interior showcases Lincoln's modern luxury approach with premium materials including available genuine wood trim, heated and ventilated seats with massage functionality, and an available 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster. Technology features include a standard 8-inch or available 13.2-inch SYNC 4 touchscreen infotainment system (updated in 2022), wireless smartphone charging, and a head-up display. Luxury touches include active noise control, acoustically laminated glass, and an available 14-speaker Revel premium audio system. Safety features come standard through Lincoln Co-Pilot360, with available Plus package adding adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go, evasive steering assist, and reverse brake assist. A refresh for 2023 brought an updated exterior with a larger grille, revised LED lighting, and an updated interior featuring a coast-to-coast dashboard design and the larger touchscreen with SYNC 4 technology. The Corsair establishes itself in the highly competitive compact luxury SUV segment by emphasizing comfort, quiet refinement, and distinctive design rather than the sport-focused approach of many competitors. Production concluded in December 2025."
